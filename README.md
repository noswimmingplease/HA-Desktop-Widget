# HA Network Dashboard

This is **Ci303's HA Network Dashboard fork** of Robertg761's HA Desktop Widget. It adds a responsive device-panel dashboard, section colours and a choice of close-button behaviour. Public fork builds install separately from the original application; the original project credits and history are retained.

Fork development is at [Ci303/HA-Desktop-Widget](https://github.com/Ci303/HA-Desktop-Widget). No fork release has been published yet; use the [fork build instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md#fork-builds) to build locally. Screenshots below are from the original application unless noted otherwise. The [original project](https://github.com/Robertg761/HA-Desktop-Widget) remains available separately.

A semi-transparent desktop widget for Home Assistant that provides quick access to your smart home devices from your desktop.

## System information setup

To display system readings using System Bridge:

1. [Download and install System Bridge](https://system-bridge.timmo.dev/install/) on each computer you want to monitor, and keep it running.
2. [Add the System Bridge integration in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/system_bridge/).
3. Select its sensor entities for your dashboard. CPU, memory, storage and GPU readings depend on the hardware and available sensors.

System Bridge is optional if another integration already provides your system sensors. It is not required for lights, switches or other existing Home Assistant entities. The widget displays Home Assistant data; it does not collect hardware readings itself.

You can find both setup links under **Settings → General → System information setup**. An unavailable reading does not by itself mean System Bridge is missing or the computer is offline.

## Settings: Personalization

Choose **Settings → Personalization → Dashboard layout → Device panels** to show all Quick Access pages as coloured panels. **Tabbed pages** retains the original layout; neither option changes your saved entities or pages.

On Windows, **Settings → General → Start in notification area at login** keeps the widget hidden when Windows starts it. Opening the app yourself or using its notification-area icon shows it normally. Startup and tray restores fit the window inside a connected monitor's working area, keeping its size whenever it fits.

Under **Settings → General → Window & Behavior**, choose **Display on monitor** and enable **Fill monitor** to fill that screen without covering the taskbar. Turning it off restores your previous window size. A disconnected preferred monitor falls back to the primary monitor until it returns. These settings stay local to this computer; monitor selection is unavailable when a Wayland compositor controls window placement.

![Personalization Tab](images/Personalization_Tab.png?v=20260601)

The Settings modal is organized into General, Personalization, Hotkeys, Alerts, and Advanced. Personalization covers color themes, window effects, weather animations, primary cards, custom entity icons, and media tile selection. General includes Home Assistant connection, window behavior, language packs, profile sync, and update checks.

## Roadmap

Planned for a future release:

- **HA Assist voice**: A microphone button wired to Home Assistant's Assist pipeline (speech-to-text → intent → text-to-speech) so you can talk to your smart home from the desktop. Deferred as a standalone update because it needs the full HA server-side audio pipeline and real device testing.

## Quick Start

### Download & Install

1. Check the [fork Releases](https://github.com/Ci303/HA-Desktop-Widget/releases) page. Until a fork release is published, follow the [local build instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md#fork-builds).
2. Windows: run the `.exe` installer or portable build. macOS: open the universal `.dmg` or `.zip` (older releases may be Apple Silicon-only). Linux: use the `.AppImage` or install the `.deb` package.
3. Run the app and click the Settings button to configure your Home Assistant connection.

> **macOS Gatekeeper notice:** Current macOS artifacts are universal, but they are
> temporarily not Apple Developer-ID signed or notarized. macOS may block the first launch
> because it cannot verify the developer. For a copy downloaded from this project's official
> GitHub Releases page, Control-click the app and choose **Open**; if needed, go to **System
> Settings > Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**. The package's ad-hoc integrity
> signature is not a substitute for Developer-ID signing. Do not bypass Gatekeeper for copies
> obtained elsewhere.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Get your Home Assistant URL**: Use the exact address you normally open in your browser, such as `http://homeassistant.local`, a legacy `http://your-ha-ip:8123` address, or `https://your-ha-domain.com`
2. **Connect the widget**: Enter that URL and click **Connect**. The app opens Home Assistant in
   your system browser so you can sign in and approve it; your Home Assistant password never enters
   the desktop app.
3. **Return to the widget**: Authorization finishes through a temporary loopback callback on this
   computer and live updates start automatically. If you change your mind, **Cancel** next to the
   connect button stops waiting and closes the loopback callback.
4. **Add entities**: Click the "+" button to add your favorite entities to Quick Access.

The legacy long-lived access-token form remains under **Settings > Legacy access token
(advanced)** for compatibility. New setups should use browser authorization.

### Home Assistant Companion Integration

The optional `HA Desktop Widget Companion` custom integration makes registered desktops visible as
native Home Assistant devices and supports `show`, `hide`, `toggle`, `switch_page`, and
`apply_profile` actions. The desktop uses the same authenticated Home Assistant WebSocket
connection for registration, state reporting, command delivery, and acknowledgements. It never
accepts arbitrary shell commands, JavaScript, file access, URLs, or generic Electron IPC from
Home Assistant.

`apply_profile` applies a named profile authored in Home Assistant: a bounded configuration
document covering appearance (theme, accent, background, opacity, frosted glass), primary cards,
Quick Access pages and tiles, comparison graphs, custom icons, and tile options. Profiles never
carry credentials, hotkeys, window geometry, desktop pins, or file-sync settings; those stay
local to each machine. The desktop reports which profile revision it last applied so Home
Assistant can flag out-of-date desktops.

> [!NOTE]
> A Home Assistant profile overwrites the sections it contains. If the folder-based profile sync
> feature is also enabled for the same sections, whichever mechanism writes last wins — avoid
> managing the same settings with both at once.

## How to Use

### Quick Access Management

- **Add Entities**: Click the "+" button to search and add entities to your dashboard
- **Reorder**: Click the Reorganize button to enter reorganize mode, then drag and drop to reorder
- **Rename**: In reorganize mode, click the edit icon to set custom display names
- **Camera Previews**: Edit a camera tile to choose an HLS live feed or a 30-second, 10-second, or 5-second snapshot cadence; previews pause while the app or tile is hidden, clicking expands the current feed without restarting it, and the expanded live view includes a Reconnect action for stale sessions
- **Remove**: In reorganize mode, click the remove button to remove entities
- **Pin to Desktop**: In reorganize mode or the tile context menu, pin supported Quick Access entities as standalone desktop tiles

### Comparison Graphs

- **Create**: Click the "+" button, then **Add comparison graph**
- **Pick entities**: Add up to 7 numeric sensors. Weather and climate entities can be graphed too — a weather entity contributes the **outside temperature** (search "outside" to find it, even though it is usually named after the integration, e.g. "Forecast Home")
- **Read it**: Series share one time axis and one value scale, so the curves are directly comparable. Hover anywhere to get a crosshair and a readout of every series at that moment
- **Units**: Entities sharing a unit share a scale. Adding a different unit (e.g. humidity next to temperature) warns and scales it separately
- **Width**: Choose 2, 3 or 4 tiles wide in the graph's editor
- **Edit / remove**: In reorganize mode, click the edit icon on the graph tile (or the remove button)

### Entity Interactions

- **Lights**: Click to toggle, long-press for brightness slider
- **Fans**: Click to toggle, long-press for speed controls
- **Covers**: Click to open/close, long-press for open/stop/close controls
- **Climate**: Long-press for target temperature and mode controls
- **Media Players**: Use the media tile controls or long-press a media player for details and seek controls
- **Cameras**: Click to view live feed in popup window
- **Sensors**: Display real-time values with automatic unit formatting
- **Timers**: Show live countdown when active
- **Scenes, Scripts & Buttons**: Click to activate, run, or press instantly

### System Integration

- **Minimize to Tray**: Click the minimize button to hide to system tray
- **Updates**: Windows installer and Linux AppImage builds can update in app; portable, macOS, and Linux deb builds offer a GitHub Releases download
- **Start at Login**: Enable or disable startup from Settings > General
- **Settings**: Access via the Settings button or right-click the tray icon

### Settings Highlights

- **General**: Configure Home Assistant connection, always-on-top, startup behavior, language packs, profile sync, and updates
- **Themes**: Choose built-in or custom accent and background colors
- **Window Effects**: Adjust opacity, toggle frosted glass, and enable subtle weather effects
- **Primary Cards**: Pin weather/time or any entity to the top two cards
- **Custom Entity Icons**: Search or paste emoji/glyph overrides for entity icons
- **Media Tile**: Select the primary media player or hide the tile
- **Hotkeys**: Configure global entity hotkeys, action-specific shortcuts, and a popup hotkey (hold/toggle on macOS and Windows; press/toggle on Linux)
- **Alerts**: Enable desktop notifications for entity state changes or target states
- **Advanced**: Open logs and enable detailed interaction diagnostics when troubleshooting

## Advanced Usage

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robertg761/HA-Desktop-Widget.git
cd HA-Desktop-Widget
npm install
npm run dev   # Development mode (opens DevTools)
npm run dev:climate-demo # Isolated simulated Fahrenheit air-conditioner demo (no HA required)
npm start     # Regular run (builds the renderer, then starts Electron)
npm run lint  # Run ESLint
npm test      # Run Jest tests
npm run dist        # Build Windows NSIS and portable artifacts
npm run dist:win    # Build Windows NSIS installer artifacts
npm run dist:mac    # Build macOS distribution artifacts
npm run dist:linux  # Build Linux AppImage and deb artifacts
```

Building the Linux artifacts additionally requires a Rust toolchain (1.98 or newer, as
pinned in `.mise.toml`) and `python3`: `npm run dist:linux` compiles the bundled
`windowtolayer` layer-shell helper from `vendor/windowtolayer` before packaging.

### Climate UI Demo (Development Only)

Run `npm run dev:climate-demo` to launch a simulated **Demo Air Conditioner** without a Home
Assistant server. The demo starts with a Fahrenheit AC entity in Quick Access and advertises
its HVAC, fan, and preset modes plus a 60–86°F target range with 1°F steps. Click the tile to
toggle it; press and hold it to exercise the target-temperature, mode, fan, and preset controls.

This command only works with the development `--dev` launch path. It creates a fresh temporary
Electron profile for that run, blocks all real Home Assistant service calls, and never reads or
writes the normal app configuration, token, desktop pins, or profile-sync data. Remove the
`dev:climate-demo` script and `development/dev-climate-demo.js` when the fixture is no longer useful.

To test the card alongside a real Home Assistant connection, run
`npm run dev:climate-overlay`. This development-only mode leaves the normal Electron profile and
Home Assistant connection intact, then places a renderer-local **Demo Air Conditioner** card at
the start of Quick Access for the current session. Its fake state and climate service calls stay
in memory and are intercepted before the WebSocket layer; the card is not saved as a favorite,
cannot be edited/removed in Quick Access, and is never written into the normal configuration or
sent to Home Assistant. The existing `npm run dev:climate-demo` remains the fully isolated mode.

Because the overlay uses the normal Electron profile, and only one widget runs per profile, it
cannot start while a copy of the widget is already running — quit that one first. The isolated
`dev:climate-demo` gets its own temporary profile and runs alongside the real widget.

### Release Channels

- **Stable releases**: Push a tag like `v3.5.4`. GitHub Actions publishes a normal release. Windows installer and Linux AppImage users can receive it through the in-app updater; portable, macOS, and Linux deb users download it from GitHub Releases.
- **Tester prereleases**: Push a SemVer prerelease tag like `v3.5.4-beta.1`. GitHub Actions marks it as a prerelease. Only users who enable **Receive beta updates** in Settings -> Application Updates are offered these builds.
- **Nightly betas**: At 07:17 UTC, GitHub Actions checks `main` against the last successfully published beta in the active series. When unreleased changes exist, it creates the next `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tag and runs the normal release workflow. The job can also be started manually from the Actions tab.
- **Manual-update builds**: Portable, macOS, and Linux deb users update from GitHub Releases. The update checker shows the appropriate stable or prerelease download when beta updates are enabled.

The minimum planned beta version is stored in `.github/beta-target`. It is currently set to
`3.9.0`, so the active series starts at `v3.9.0-beta.1`. Once `v3.9.0` is stable, the workflow
automatically moves to `v3.9.1-beta.N`; increasing the file starts a future minor series instead.

Release builds align their package version from the tag. Manually prepared betas commit matching
prerelease metadata before tagging; automated nightly betas align it only inside the build.
Stable releases continue to sync `package.json` and `package-lock.json` after publishing.

New GitHub releases automatically generate notes from merged pull requests and contributors. A beta compares against the previous published prerelease in the same version series, falling back to the latest stable release for the first beta. A stable release compares against the previous stable release so its notes cover the complete release cycle rather than only the changes since the last beta.

### Configuration

- **Config Location**: Stored as `config.json` in Electron's userData directory.
  - **Windows (packaged)**: `%AppData%/Home Assistant Widget/config.json`
  - **macOS (packaged)**: `~/Library/Application Support/HA Desktop Widget/config.json`
  - **Linux (packaged)**: `~/.config/HA Desktop Widget/config.json`
  - **Development builds**: typically use `home-assistant-widget` as the folder name
- **Config Contents**: `homeAssistant` (url and auth method; encrypted token fields only for legacy-token authentication), `desktopCompanion` (a random installation ID), `favoriteEntities`, `customEntityNames`,
  `desktopPins`, `customEntityIcons`, `quickAccessTileOptions`, `tileSpans`, `selectedWeatherEntity`, `primaryMediaPlayer`,
  `globalHotkeys`, `entityAlerts`, `popupHotkey`, `windowPosition`, `windowSize`, `opacity`, `ui` (theme, accent, background,
  language, customColors, timeFormat, dateFormat, use24HourClock, weatherEffectsEnabled, weatherOverride, enableInteractionDebugLogs),
  and `customTabs`. Other stored values include `primaryCards`, `alwaysOnTop`, `frostedGlass`,
  `popupHotkeyHideOnRelease`, `popupHotkeyToggleMode`, `updates`, and `profileSync`.
- **Security**: OAuth refresh tokens are stored in a separate OS-encrypted credential file and
  short-lived access tokens remain in memory. OAuth pairing fails closed when secure storage is
  unavailable. Legacy tokens are encrypted at rest when supported by the OS and are never stored in
  plaintext as a fallback.

### Profile Sync (Opt-in)

- **Providers**: `cloudFile` (generic), `googleDrive`, `icloudDrive`, and `syncthing` all use the same cloud-folder JSON sync file model.
- **Default sync folder**: Starts in the app's local data folder (`userData`) and stores profile data in `ha-widget-profile-sync.json`.
- **Folder changes**: When switching folders, the app can copy the existing sync file to the new location or keep the current folder.
- **Sync scope controls**: Choose presets (`All`, `Visual`, `Quick Access`) or use advanced custom sections for Quick Access/layout, visual personalization, automation/alerts, and connection/media preferences.
- **Need help button**: Opens profile sync setup instructions in your browser.
- **Sync behavior**: On startup the newer side wins (offline edits on this device are pushed instead of discarded), pushes on profile changes (debounced), and periodic sync every 5 minutes (default).
- **Conflict handling**: First-time setup prompts you to keep local profile or use remote profile; ongoing conflicts use last-write-wins on the whole profile (no per-field merge). The sync file is re-read immediately before it is overwritten, so a write that landed from another device in the meantime is not discarded. Because direction is chosen by timestamp, large clock skew between devices can still pick the wrong winner. Conflict copies created by cloud sync clients (e.g. Syncthing `.sync-conflict-` or Dropbox "conflicted copy" files) are detected and reported in Settings, but resolving them is left to you — the app never deletes them.
- **Safety net**: Before a remote profile is applied, the previous local profile is backed up to `profile-sync-backups/` in the app's data folder (the last 5 are kept).
- **Encryption**: Optional passphrase encryption for synced payloads (`AES-256-GCM` with `scrypt` key derivation); passphrases must be at least 8 characters.
- **Schema compatibility**: Sync writes use profile sync schema v2; older app versions must update to participate in sync.
- **Local-only data**: Home Assistant authorization, desktop installation ID, window position/size, startup setting, and profile-sync internals remain local.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **Verify URL**: Ensure your Home Assistant URL is accessible from your computer
- **Reconnect authorization**: In Settings, click **Reconnect with Home Assistant** if authorization expired. Legacy-token users should verify that token manually.
- **Firewall**: Ensure your OS firewall allows the app to connect to your network
- **Network**: Test connectivity by opening your HA URL in a web browser

### Performance Issues

- **Reduce Entities**: Limit the number of entities in Quick Access
- **Visual Effects**: Disable transparency if experiencing performance issues

### Common Solutions

- **Restart**: Close and reopen the app if entities aren't updating
- **Reconnect**: Go to Settings and click **Reconnect with Home Assistant**
- **Check Logs**: Use Settings > View Logs to open the log file location
