# Contributing to HA Desktop Widget

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HA Desktop Widget! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS
- npm 11.19.x or newer within npm 11 (`npm install --global npm@11.19.0`)
- Git
- Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, or a current Linux desktop

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HA-Desktop-Widget.git
   cd HA-Desktop-Widget
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start development mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### Fork builds

The standard `dist` scripts build **HA Network Dashboard**, with a separate application ID, profile and update destination. `npm run dist:fork:win` puts Windows artifacts in `dist-fork`; the other public build scripts use `dist`.

`npm run dist:local:win` is deliberately different: it replaces the original per-user HA Desktop Widget installation, retains its profile and disables automatic updates. Back up that profile before installing a local replacement. Do not publish the local replacement as a fork release.

Development launches use an isolated profile and cannot change the installed application's Start at login setting. Only Windows packaging and runtime checks have been verified locally; macOS and Linux builds still need their CI checks.

Dependency installation and packaging share `scripts/rebuild-native-dependencies.cjs`. It rebuilds runtime native addons for the target Electron architecture, excluding the unused `usocket` addon. The Linux D-Bus integrations use Node's `net.Socket` instead; `usocket` is excluded from every package and its install script is disabled.

### Reporting Issues

- **Bug Reports**: Use the [fork Issues](https://github.com/noswimmingplease/HA-Desktop-Widget/issues) page
- **Feature Requests**: Submit enhancement ideas with detailed descriptions
- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available; otherwise follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to contact the maintainer privately

## 📝 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Electron

- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over Promises when possible

### CSS/Styling

- **CSS Variables**: Use existing CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
- **Responsive**: Ensure styles work across different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Avoid expensive CSS properties in animations
- **Consistency**: Follow the existing design system

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- **Modularity**: Break large functions into smaller, focused functions
- **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling and user feedback

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

- Test all new features thoroughly
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Test on each operating system affected by the change when possible
- Treat Wayland/X11, native-window, tray, global-shortcut, and updater behavior as platform-specific
- Check performance with various numbers of entities

### Automated Testing

- Run the existing test suite:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Add tests for new features when appropriate
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
